# 📚 Turkish Emotion Classifier

A simple Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that classifies Turkish text into emotions like **happy**, **sad**, **angry**, and **neutral**.  
The model is trained on a labeled dataset and deployed with a lightweight **Streamlit** web application for real-time prediction.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Lowercasing text
   - Removing punctuation
   - Tokenizing words

2. **Feature Extraction**  
   - Convert text into numerical features using **CountVectorizer**.

3. **Model Training**  
   - Train a **Logistic Regression** classifier on the extracted features.

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. **Web App Deployment**  
   - Create an interactive user interface with **Streamlit** where users can input Turkish sentences and receive emotion predictions.

## 🎯 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/turkish-text-classifier.git
   cd turkish-text-classifier
   ```

## ✨ Future Improvements

- Fine-tune a deep learning model (e.g., BERTurk).
- Expand the dataset with more labeled examples.
- Add more emotion classes (like Fear, Disgust, Surprise).
